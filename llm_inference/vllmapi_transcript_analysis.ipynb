However, there is a brief discussion about tariffs in the context of the current market environment and their potential impact on the portfolio. The CEO mentions that the company is \"relatively insulated\" from movements in foreign exchange rates and tariffs due to the construction of the portfolio, which is primarily focused on U.S. borrowers. The CEO also notes that the company has done work to assess potential tariff vulnerability and does not believe they have a meaningful exposure on a first-order basis. However, the CEO cautions that the second, third, and fourth-order impacts of tariffs are uncertain and could potentially affect the portfolio.\n",

The CEO also notes that the company has done work to assess potential tariff vulnerability and does not believe they have a meaningful exposure on a first-order basis. However, the CEO cautions that the second, third, and fourth-order impacts of tariffs are uncertain and could potentially affect the portfolio.\\n\\nThe discussion of tariffs is implicit, and the company does not provide specific details about the nature of the tariffs, the countries imposing them, or the countries subject to them. The CEO's comments suggest that the company is monitoring the situation and is prepared to adapt to any changes in the market environment.\\n\\nThere is no discussion of the impact of tariffs on the company's current or future profits, investment decisions, or behavior. The company's focus is on its core business and managing its portfolio to achieve strong returns, rather than on responding to potential tariff impacts.\",\n",
