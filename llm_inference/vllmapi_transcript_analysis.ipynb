The firm expects increased demand in the U.S. and stable demand in Europe for their roll business if tariffs are implemented.

      "  \"analysis\": \"The firm discusses tariffs explicitly in the transcript. They mention that the tariffs are not expected to have a significant direct impact on their business, but they may have indirect effects through changing demand dynamics involving customers in Canada and Mexico. The firm expects increased demand in the U.S. and stable demand in Europe for their roll business if tariffs are implemented. They also mention that many of their largest competitors for their Forged and Cast Engineered Products (FEP) business are outside the U.S., which could lead to increased demand for their FEP products.\\n\\nThe tariffs discussed are current and potential future tariffs. The firm mentions that mill rolls are not subject to tariffs, as they are classified as rolling mill components or parts, not as steel products like tool steel or rebar. The countries imposing tariffs are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the U.S. is one of them, given the discussion about the potential impact on demand in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.\\n\\nThe firm does not expect tariffs to have a significant impact on their current profits. However, they do expect potential future impacts, including changes in demand dynamics and potential increases in demand for their products. The firm's behavior may be affected by tariffs, as they are already seeing an improved order book for their FEP products in anticipation of tariffs.\\n\\nThe geographies affected by the changes in the firm's behavior are the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Europe. The firm mentions that they are seeing positive signs in hot mill activities in Europe and that the nuclear market is expected to be a growth area for them.\",\n",
